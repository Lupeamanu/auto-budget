# Auto Budget
Simple CLI tool to quickly add savings entries to a pre-defined Google Sheet.

## Why?
I am planning a trip and wanted an easy way to input wheneve I save an amount of money for this trip. I have found that I often forget to open Google Sheets, but am always in the terminal.

## Functionality
Via terminal, specifiy amount saved and to which category.

Script will automatically calculate:
- Cumulative saved
- How much should have been saved by the current date
- How much you are ahead or behind of the current savings goal

Once this data is calculated, script will update appropriate columns in a Google Sheet.
